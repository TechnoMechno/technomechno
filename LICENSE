MIT License
I chose the MIT License for my project because itâ€™s a highly permissive license that allows others to freely use, modify, distribute, and even commercialize the code, as long as they include the original license and copyright notice. This license encourages wide adoption and collaboration by removing barriers to usage, making it ideal for open-source projects where I want to maximize accessibility and flexibility for developers while keeping attribution intact.
